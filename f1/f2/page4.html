<div class = txt>Eskimo Callboy is a German metalcore band formed in Castrop-Rauxel in 2010.The band's musical style can be described 
    as a mix of metalcore, comedy rock, and post-hardcore with electronic music. The band's style is influenced by techno, so it can be called electronicore. The musicians named bands like
     Asking Alexandria and Attack Attack! as their musical influences. Their singer stated that the musicians don't feel like being a part of the "hardcore music scene"
     On festivals the group shared stage with acts like Casper, Distance in Embrace and Rantanplan. In 2011 they played at Traffic Jam Open Air and Mair Festival. Their debut album, Bury Me in Vegas was released on March 23, 2012 worldwide via Redfield Records. Between September 28 and September 30, 2012 the band toured in Japan on the Geki Rock Tour. After the Geki Rock the group toured China and Russian Federation. In October and November 2012 Eskimo Callboy was support act alongside the Electro duo WassBass (founded by Nico of K.I.Z) for Callejon on their Blitzkreuz Tour which lead through Germany and Austria. On the last show of the tour at Live Music Hall in Cologne on November 10, 2012, nine fans got hurt after pieces of the ceiling fell down in the moshpit area. The concert was stopped and rescheduled on February 23, 2013, at E-Werk in Cologne. The band did not appear on the new date because they were touring alongside The Browning, Close to Home and Intohimo through Europe on that time.
