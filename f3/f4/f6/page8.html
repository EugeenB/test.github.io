        Король и Шут (King and Jester) (abbreviated “КиШ”) is a Russian horror punk band from St. Petersburg.
        The group was formed in Leningrad in 1988. After the death of its leader and one of the founders, Mikhail Gorshenov, on July 19, 2013, he performs only in the rock opera TODD.
        It stands out for its unusual style for classic punk rock. The songs of the group are small finished stories, often in a fantasy, mystical, as well as historical manner. The stage image of the group was constantly changing and often included make-up corresponding to the theme of the songs. In the press, the group was repeatedly designated as “cult”.

<div class = txt>КняZz is a Russian rock band from St. Petersburg, created in 2011 by Andrei Knyazev, who at the time of its creation was a member of the horror rock band K&J. In the spring of 2011, Andrei Knyazev refused to work in the theater on the TODD zong-opera together with Mikhail Gorshenev and decided to create a side project for the realization of his own creative potential. On December 16, 2011, Andrei Knyazev officially announced his retirement from the “King and the Jester”. In terms of the lyrical filling of the songs, the style of the new group in many respects continued the work of Andrei Knyazev in K&J</div>
